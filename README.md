# Power Ball Project

My Assignment was to create a PowerBall Game

It's a game that's very similar to a lottery .

with only five white balls in the 1-20 range 
and 1 gold number in the range 1- 10.

The user numbers are automatic ,

And in any case the Power ball has a suitable prize

In this project, I added the option for a user who can determine
the range of numbers himself, and therefore the program becomes more generic


I used in OOP , Functions, Loops , If,Elif,Else Conditions
and The Random module



Thank You,
